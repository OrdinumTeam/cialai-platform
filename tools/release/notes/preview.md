## Cialai {{version}} preview

An early preview of Cialai for macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. Expect rough edges.

**macOS is signed with the Ordinum Developer ID and notarized by Apple.** **The Windows installers are not signed with a code signing certificate yet**, so SmartScreen warns you before the first launch. In app updates are verified with the Cialai updater key on every system.

### What is new

* **A new application icon,** the mantis head in colour on a white rounded plate. On the phone the plate fills the frame, because the system is what rounds it; on the desktop it steps back to the macOS grid so the icon does not touch its neighbours in the Dock.
* **The same icon on iPhone, on Android and in the browser tab.** On Android the adaptive foreground is the colour artwork over the white that plays the part of the plate, and it fits the 66 dp safe zone.
* **The `cialai` command is found on Linux.** Typing it gave command not found, because `~/.local/bin` only reaches PATH through a login file that runs before Cialai creates the folder. The application now writes a marked, guarded block into the file your terminal actually reads, with a backup first and an exact removal from Preferences.
* **Dialogs position themselves.** In the installed 0.2.7 the pairing sheet could appear at the bottom corner of the window with no scrim and no centring. The fixed layer, the centring and the scrim now come from the application stylesheet, not from styles injected at runtime.
* **Release announcements are one block per highlight,** instead of a wall of text.

### Which file to download

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| macOS on Apple silicon | `Cialai_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS on Intel | `Cialai_x64.dmg` |
| Windows 10 and 11 | `Cialai_x64-setup.exe` or `Cialai_x64.msi` |
| Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives | `Cialai_amd64.deb` |
| Fedora, openSUSE and derivatives | `Cialai_x86_64.rpm` |
| Other Linux distributions | `Cialai_amd64.AppImage` |
| Android 8 or newer | `Cialai_android_universal.apk` |

On iPhone the preview goes through TestFlight, so there is no file to download.

### Install

**macOS.** Open the DMG, drag Cialai to Applications, then open it and click Open on the first launch.

**Windows.** Run the setup or the MSI. On the SmartScreen warning click More info, then Run anyway.

**Linux.** `sudo apt install ./Cialai_amd64.deb`, `sudo dnf install ./Cialai_x86_64.rpm`, or make the AppImage executable with `chmod +x` and run it. The app updates itself in all three formats.

**Android.** Download the APK on the phone, allow installing unknown apps when Android asks, then open it.

**macOS and Linux in one line.** `curl -fsSL https://cialai.com.br/install.sh | bash`

### Verify your download

`SHA256SUMS` lists the checksum of every file here.

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

Use `sha256sum` instead of `shasum -a 256` on Linux.

### Public networks and limits

Cialai runs no server of its own, and neither does Ordinum. The connection uses the Tor network as meeting point and backup, optional STUN servers from Cloudflare and Google, and DNS-SD on your local network.

The computer must be on with Cialai open. A network that blocks both Tor and UDP leaves the phone without a path, and the backup through Tor is slower than a direct connection.
