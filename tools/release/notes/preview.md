## Cialai {{version}} preview

A quiet fix of Cialai for macOS, Windows and Linux, on top of 0.4.3. The first run on Windows no longer stays on Opening at the PTY test. The phone apps are unchanged.

**macOS is signed with the Ordinum Developer ID and notarized by Apple.** **The Windows installers are not signed with a code signing certificate yet**, so SmartScreen warns you before the first launch. In app updates are verified with the Cialai updater key on every system.

### What is fixed

* **The Windows first run gets past the shell step.** The PTY test now answers the cursor query the Windows console is born with and reads its output to the end before closing it. Before Windows 11 24H2, closing the console waits for that output to be read, so the test used to hang on Opening.
* **The prompt shows up clean.** The test waits for the prompt to settle and strips the window title the console sends before it.

### Which file to download

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| macOS on Apple silicon | `Cialai_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS on Intel | `Cialai_x64.dmg` |
| Windows 10 and 11 | `Cialai_x64-setup.exe` or `Cialai_x64.msi` |
| Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives | `Cialai_amd64.deb` |
| Fedora, openSUSE and derivatives | `Cialai_x86_64.rpm` |
| Other Linux distributions | `Cialai_amd64.AppImage` |

The Android and iPhone apps are unchanged in this preview and keep working with it. Android still gets `Cialai_android_universal.apk` from the site and iPhone the TestFlight build.

### Install

**macOS.** Open the DMG, drag Cialai to Applications, then open it and click Open on the first launch.

**Windows.** Run the setup or the MSI. On the SmartScreen warning click More info, then Run anyway.

**Linux.** `sudo apt install ./Cialai_amd64.deb`, `sudo dnf install ./Cialai_x86_64.rpm`, or make the AppImage executable with `chmod +x` and run it. The app updates itself in all three formats.

**macOS and Linux in one line.** `curl -fsSL https://cialai.com.br/install.sh | bash`

### Verify your download

`SHA256SUMS` lists the checksum of every file here.

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

Use `sha256sum` instead of `shasum -a 256` on Linux.

### Public networks and limits

Cialai runs no server of its own, and neither does Ordinum. The connection uses the Tor network as meeting point and backup, optional STUN servers from Cloudflare and Google, and DNS-SD on your local network.

The computer must be on with Cialai open. A network that blocks both Tor and UDP leaves the phone without a path, and the backup through Tor is slower than a direct connection.
