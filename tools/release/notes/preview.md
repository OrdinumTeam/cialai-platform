## Cialai {{version}} preview

An early preview of Cialai for macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and iOS. Expect rough edges.

**macOS is signed with the Ordinum Developer ID and notarized by Apple.** **The Windows installers are not signed with a code signing certificate yet**, so SmartScreen warns you before the first launch. In app updates are verified with the Cialai updater key on every system.

### What is new

* **Windows works from the keyboard again.** In 0.2.9 nothing typed reached the application on Windows 11 while clicks still worked: the window asked the WebView2 to take focus on every focus event, Windows raises that event from the WebView2 itself, and the two handed the focus back and forth forever. The call now runs only on macOS and Linux.
* **The Windows terminal has its colours and its font.** The content security policy blocked the style sheet xterm injects at runtime, because a hash had been added to `style-src` and a hash makes the browser ignore `'unsafe-inline'`.
* **`claude` and `codex` are found right after installing on Windows.** The default PATH folders were empty and the PATH was copied once at launch. The usual installer folders are now on the list and the PATH is read from the registry for every new shell, so nothing has to be configured.
* **No more `[I` when clicking back into the terminal on Windows.** The focus reports the terminal emits are discarded before they reach Windows PowerShell, whose PSReadLine echoed them as text.
* **The drag hint names Alt outside macOS.**

### Which file to download

| Platform | File |
| --- | --- |
| macOS on Apple silicon | `Cialai_aarch64.dmg` |
| macOS on Intel | `Cialai_x64.dmg` |
| Windows 10 and 11 | `Cialai_x64-setup.exe` or `Cialai_x64.msi` |
| Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives | `Cialai_amd64.deb` |
| Fedora, openSUSE and derivatives | `Cialai_x86_64.rpm` |
| Other Linux distributions | `Cialai_amd64.AppImage` |
| Android 8 or newer | `Cialai_android_universal.apk` |

On iPhone the preview goes through TestFlight, so there is no file to download.

### Install

**macOS.** Open the DMG, drag Cialai to Applications, then open it and click Open on the first launch.

**Windows.** Run the setup or the MSI. On the SmartScreen warning click More info, then Run anyway.

**Linux.** `sudo apt install ./Cialai_amd64.deb`, `sudo dnf install ./Cialai_x86_64.rpm`, or make the AppImage executable with `chmod +x` and run it. The app updates itself in all three formats.

**Android.** Download the APK on the phone, allow installing unknown apps when Android asks, then open it.

**macOS and Linux in one line.** `curl -fsSL https://cialai.com.br/install.sh | bash`

### Verify your download

`SHA256SUMS` lists the checksum of every file here.

```sh
shasum -a 256 -c SHA256SUMS --ignore-missing
```

Use `sha256sum` instead of `shasum -a 256` on Linux.

### Public networks and limits

Cialai runs no server of its own, and neither does Ordinum. The connection uses the Tor network as meeting point and backup, optional STUN servers from Cloudflare and Google, and DNS-SD on your local network.

The computer must be on with Cialai open. A network that blocks both Tor and UDP leaves the phone without a path, and the backup through Tor is slower than a direct connection.
